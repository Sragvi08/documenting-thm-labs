# Lab 01: Intro to Networking 📝

## Objective
The objective of this lab was to build foundational networking knowledge by understanding how data packets move across networks, how protocols communicate, and how this knowledge applies to traffic analysis in cybersecurity.

## Tools
- Ping – testing network connectivity
- Traceroute – identifying packet paths
- whois - gathering domain and IP registration information
- Dig - to manually query recursive DNS servers of our choice. 

## Procedure
- Studied the OSI and TCP/IP models to understand how data moves across networks.
- Identified common networking protocols and their associated ports.
- Used basic networking tools to observe communication between hosts.
- Performed basic domain and IP information gathering using whois.

## What did I learn?
- Gained a clearer understanding of the OSI and TCP/IP models and how each layer
  contributes to data transmission across a network.
- Learned how encapsulation works by adding protocol-specific headers at each layer,
  with the data link layer also appending a trailer used for error detection.
- Understood the TCP three-way handshake and the role of SYN and ACK flags in
  establishing reliable connections between hosts.
- Learned how Time To Live (TTL) values help prevent packets from looping indefinitely
  across a network and how TTL is used by tools such as traceroute.
